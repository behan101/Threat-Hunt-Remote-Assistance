# 🕵️‍♂️ Threat Hunt: *"Remote Assistance"*

## Scenario

> *"A routine support request should have ended with a reset and reassurance. Instead, the so-called “help”
left behind a trail of anomalies that don’t add up."*

What was framed as troubleshooting looked more like an audit of the system itself — probing, cataloging,
leaving subtle traces in its wake. Actions chained together in suspicious sequence: first gaining a foothold,
then expanding reach, then preparing to linger long after the session ended.
And just when the activity should have raised questions, a neat explanation appeared — a story planted in
plain sight, designed to justify the very behavior that demanded scrutiny.
This wasn’t remote assistance. It was a misdirection.
Your mission this time is to reconstruct the timeline, connect the scattered remnants of this “support
session”, and decide what was legitimate, and what was staged.
The evidence is here. The question is whether you’ll see through the story or believe it.

This report includes:

- 📅 Timeline reconstruction of auditing, reconnaissance, and attempted exfiltration of data on the device **`gab-intern-vm`**
- 📜 Detailed queries using Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting (KQL)
- 🧠 MITRE ATT&CK mapping to understand TTP alignment
- 🧪 Evidence-based summaries supporting each flag and behavior discovered


---

## 🧰 Platforms and Tools

**Analysis Environment:**
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure

**Techniques Used:**
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Behavioral analysis of endpoint logs (DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents, DeviceRegistryEvents)

### 🚩 Flag 0: Starting Point - Suspicious Processes Spawning in Downloads

**Objective:**
Determine where to start hunting with the following intel:
1. Multiple machines in the department started spawning processes originating from the download folders.
This unexpected scenario occurred during the first half of October.
2. Several machines were found to share the same types of files — similar executables, naming patterns,
and other traits.
3. Common keywords among the discovered files included “desk,” “help,” “support,” and “tool.”
4. Intern operated machines seem to be affected to certain degree.

**Flag Value:**
`gab-intern-vm`

**Detection Strategy:**
Multiple alerts were issued indicating that multiple machines were spawning processes originating from the 'download' folders around the first half of October (10/01/2025 - 10/15/2025). Common keywords among the discovered files included "desk", "help", "support", and "tool". The following query was used in Microsoft Defender to find any files associated with the keywords:

**KQLQuery:**
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where ActionType == "FileCreated"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-10-01) .. datetime(2025-10-15))
| where FileName matches regex @"(?i)(desk|help|support|tool)"
| where FolderPath has @"\Downloads\"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, SHA1, InitiatingProcessAccountName
| order by Timestamp desc
```
**Evidence:**

The initial query showed suspicious files that were downloaded with the keywords in the alert. The affected device was identified as `gab-intern-vm`.

**Why This Matters:**
The query allowed us to narrow down the affected machines that may be responsible for the alert.

### 🚩 Flag 1: Initial Execution Detection

**Objective:**
Detect the earliest anomalous execution that could represent an entry point.

**Flag Value:**
-ExecutionPolicy

**Detection Strategy:**
In order to find the earliest anomalous execution, the query needed to be fine-tuned to look for suspicious Command Line Interface (CLI) parameters.
